Introduction
======================================

A generic read-only block-level disk cache solution optimized for
Flash storage. It can transparently cache from any block device target
(typically HDD) to another block device that is used as a cache
(typically SSD). It dynamically hooks/unhooks into the target block
device, even if it is already mounted, and thus enables seamless
application acceleration. Also, it supports caching from one or more
targets to one or more targets (e.g., 3 HDDs caching to 1SSD). It
supports asynchronous write-through.

Details on the architecture of iostash can be found in the research
papers listed in the References section.


Requirements
======================================

iostash is a Linux kernel module that depends on the device-mapper
Linux kernel framework (most mainstream Linux distros use a kernel
build that include this feature).

It should build for kernel version 2.6.28 and onwards, and has been
tested on RHEL6.4 (2.6.32-504.23.4.el6.x86_64) and Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
(3.16.0-46-generic).

Building requires having the kernel targets and the necessary
compilation tools:
CentOS/RHEL: https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/BuildingKernelModules
Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile


Installation
======================================
1. Download:
The latest version of iostash can be found at github:
https://github.com/ibm-research/iostash
git://github.com/ibm-research/iostash.git

2. Build:
Make sure you have the kernel target and compilation tools. For Ubuntu
14.04.3, for example, these can be installed using:
sudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-`uname -r`

Enter the iostash directory and run:
make && make install

The above instructions will build and install a kernel module for the
currently loaded kernel on the build system. One can build for a
specific kernel version by setting the KERNEL_DIR to the path for the
desired kernel.

A user-interface script will also be installed under /usr/bin/iostash.


Usage
======================================

1. Add a device target to start caching from (say /dev/sda):
sudo iostash target add /dev/sda

2. Add a new device to the cache (say /dev/nvme0n1):
sudo iostash cache add /dev/nvme0n1

3. List all device targets that we are caching from:
sudo iostash target list

4. List all devices that we are caching to:
sudo iostash cache list

5. Stop caching from a device target (say /dev/sda):
sudo iostash target remove /dev/sda

6. Remove a device from the pool of caching device (say /dev/nvme0n1):
sudo iostash cache remove /dev/nvme0n1

7. View global statistics (cache hits, etc):
sudo iostash global stats
